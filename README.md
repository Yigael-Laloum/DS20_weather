# Weather Data Fetching ApplicationProject

OverviewIn this project, I aim to create a text-based Python application in a Google Colab notebook to fetch and display weather data for any location I specify. 

I will utilize an API from a weather data provider website to retrieve accurate and up-to-date weather information. 
This project helps me strengthen my understanding of Python programming, JSON structures, and RESTful APIs.
Additionally, I will use Poetry to manage dependencies efficiently and enable Streamlit to run the application I build.
